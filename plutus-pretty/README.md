## What is this?

## So what can this do?

## What are the goals of this project?

### Convenience

Testing Plutus-based code can be a significant challenge. `tasty-plutus`, by a
mixture of good integration with the `tasty` ecosystem and well-chosen testing
APIs, aims to make it more straightforward. In particular, we want to codify
folklore practices or discoveries and make them accessible to everyone.

### Good failure reporting

Knowing that a test failed is often far less useful than knowing _why_ it
failed. To this end, `tasty-plutus` aims to give the most useful information it
can about the context of the failures, and present it in a readable and concise
way.

### Integration with `tasty`

The `tasty` test framework is well-supported for a range of testing types, is
extensible, scriptable, and provides a lot of solutions to 'boilerplate' around
testing. `tasty-plutus` will use this whenever possible, and in general, try to
be a 'good citizen' of the `tasty` universe.
